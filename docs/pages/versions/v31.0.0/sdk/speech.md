This module allows using Text-to-speech utility.

### `Speech.speak(text, options)`

Speak out loud the `text` given `options`. Calling this when another text is being spoken adds an utterance to queue.

#### Arguments

-   **text : `string`** -- The text to be spoken.
-   **options : `object`** --

      A map of options:

    -   **language : `string`** -- The code of a language that should be used to read the `text`, check out IETF BCP 47 to see valid codes.
    -   **pitch : `number`** -- Pitch of the voice to speak `text`. 1.0 is the normal pitch.
    -   **rate : `number`** -- Rate of the voice to speak `text`. 1.0 is the normal rate.
    -   **onStart : `function`** -- A callback that is invoked when speaking starts.
    -   **onDone : `function`** -- A callback that is invoked when speaking finishes.
    -   **onStopped : `function`** -- A callback that is invoked when speaking is stopped by calling `Speech.stop()`.
    -   **onError : `function`** -- (Android only). A callback that is invoked when an error occurred while speaking.

### `Speech.stop()`

Interrupts current speech and deletes all in queue.

### `Speech.pause()`

Pauses current speech.

### `Speech.resume()`

Resumes speaking previously paused speech or does nothing if there's none.

### `Speech.isSpeakingAsync()`

Determine whether the Text-to-speech utility is currently speaking. Will return `true` if speaker is paused.

#### Returns

Returns a Promise that resolves to a boolean, `true` if speaking, `false` if not.
