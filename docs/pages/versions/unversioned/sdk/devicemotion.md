import withDocumentationElements from '~/components/page-higher-order/withDocumentationElements';

export default withDocumentationElements(meta);

Access the device motion and orientation sensors. All data is presented in terms of three axes that run through a device. According to portrait orientation: X runs from left to right, Y from bottom to top and Z perpendicularly through the screen from back to front.

### `DangerZone.DeviceMotion.isAvailableAsync()`

Returns whether device motion is enabled on the device.

#### Returns

- A promise that resolves to a `boolean` denoting the availability of the sensor.

### `DangerZone.DeviceMotion.addListener(listener)`

Subscribe for updates to DeviceMotion.

#### Arguments

- **listener : `function`** -- A callback that is invoked when a
  DeviceMotion update is available. When invoked, the listener is
  provided a single argument that is an object containing following fields:

  - **acceleration : `object`** -- Device acceleration on the three axis as an object with x, y, z keys. Expressed in m/s<sup>2</sup>.

  - **accelerationIncludingGravity : `object`** -- Device acceleration with the effect of gravity on the three axis as an object with x, y, z keys. Expressed in m/s<sup>2</sup>.

  - **rotation : `object`** -- Device's orientation in space as an object with alpha, beta, gamma keys where alpha is for rotation around Z axis, beta for X axis rotation and gamma for Y axis rotation.

  - **rotationRate : `object`** -- Rotation rates of the device around each of its axes as an object with alpha, beta, gamma keys where alpha is around Z axis, beta for X axis and gamma for Y axis.

  - **orientation : `number`** -- Device orientation based on screen rotation. Value is on of `0` (portrait), `90` (right landscape), `180` (upside down), `-90` (left landscape).

#### Returns

- A subscription that you can call `remove()` on when you
  would like to unsubscribe the listener.

### `DangerZone.DeviceMotion.removeAllListeners()`

Remove all listeners.

### `DangerZone.DeviceMotion.setUpdateInterval(intervalMs)`

Subscribe for updates to DeviceMotion.

#### Arguments

- **intervalMs : `number`** Desired interval in milliseconds between
  DeviceMotion updates.
